1: Cut whitespace,
2: if string is empty, read a new line -> step 1
3: If no new line is available, eof token -> step 1
4: Check if it is a comment, in that case, search until the matching or eof -> Step 1

5: Find the length of name, number and each token as well as string
    Length 0 if no match
    If there are multiple values, there are multiple ways to interpret.
        - Longest wins
        - If tie, predefined, then number, then name
        - String will always be separate because it has to start with '
    Then make a token and increment the string, repeat step 1^
